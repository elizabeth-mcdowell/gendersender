  Hello everyone! 
  My name's Raisa Bhuiyan and I'm one of the co-heads for the web and software team at the NU Sci magazine! My co-head Ethan is CC-ed on this email, and we're emailing because we saw you all expressed interest in joining the web and software team! We would love to have you all if you are still interested. 
  Just some important context as to what you all can expect: we meet twice a week on Mondays from 7-8 PM and on Wednesdays from 7-8PM. If you were to join the team, you can expect to learn about full stack web development and make valuable contributions to the magazine. When you join the team, we're gonna have you work through five "phases" of a custom guided project. In doing so, you'll learn more about concepts like Github, remote databases, routes, etc. At the end, you'll have created a site that you can put on your resume. Once you get through the custom project, you'll be expected to work on tickets that will be contributing to the magazine website. We hope to see you all join. 
  Please respond to this email if you are interested so we can add you to the slack!
