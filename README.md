We recommend installing the required libraries in a venv/conda environment, it is however not necessary to do so. 

You will need two terminal windows, one two run the backend and one to run the frontend. 

To run the backend:

1. Install FastAPI: `pip install fastapi`
2. Install Uvicorn: `pip install "uvicorn[standard]"`
3. Navigate to the backend folder 
4. Run  `uvicorn main:app --reload`, you will know when the backend is running when you see `Application startup complete` in the terminal.

To run the frontend:

(to be completed)
